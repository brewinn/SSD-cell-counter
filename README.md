# SSD-cell-counter
Project for CS-6243, processing and labeling microscope images of mice microglia.

## Info
This project consisted of three main portions:
1. Preprocess the dataset to make it more amenable to ML techniques.
2. Create, train, and utilize an ML model on the dataset.
3. Using WandB and other methods, record and report on the model's performance.

I've left out the dataset used for this project as it is large and essentially unlabeled, aside from the small set used in the training process.
For further explaination and a view of the results, take a look at `ML Final Presentation.pdf`.
